               !LanMan98
               =========

!LanMan98 is a program for networking Acorn computers, running RISC OS with
PCs, running Windows 95, 98, NT, etc.  It allows users of RISC OS based
machines full access to remote PC shares.  That is the same role fulfilled by
LanManFS under !Omniclient, but !LanMan98 offers several advantages over the
older system.

* !LanMan98 allows files to be displayed and accessed via their long file
  names, rather than the garbled, backward-compatibility DOS names.

* !LanMan98 is very much faster than LanManFS across TCP/IP (although it is
  not quite as fast as LanManFS across NetBEUI.

* !LanMan98 prevents the common time-out problems when connected to
  Windows NT servers.

* !LanMan98 allows use of long file names when a PC is used as a RISC OS file
  server.

* !LanMan98 allows shares to be accessed across the internet.

* !LanMan98 is the only TCP/IP-based file system that can tolerate file
  accesses under callback.  Because of this, Fresco does not need to be
  patched to function correctly on discless machines, and can work more
  efficiently.


!LanMan98 can be used as a stand alone system (with or without Atomwide's
excellent !NTFiler frontend),  or it can be used with !Omniclient as an
extension/alternative to LanManFS.  (See the section on installation for
the setting up procedure for the different styles of use).


!LanMan98 implements the CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocol, which
has arisen out of microsoft's earlier SMB protocol (the protocols used by
LanManFS).  There are people working towards standardising CIFS, for the more
general use suggested by the expanded form of its name, and there are already
servers written for a large number of different platforms; so you may find
uses for !LanMan98 other than just communication between RISC OS and Windows.
On the other hand, the current situation is a terrible mess, with the Windows
95, NT and Vista servers being so different that they cannot be driven in a
consistent way.

Certainly, users must realise that this version of !LanMan98 was originally
written for communication with Windows 95, Windows NT, Windows 98 and
SAMBA only; recent changes have worked around bugs in servers such as Windows
Vista and some NAS hardware. Success with any other server should be considered
as a fortuitous event though.

alongside !LanMan98.  Some libraries may have other licences which will
be stated in their relevant documentation.


Prerequisites
=============

At this point, we are going to assume the following things.

* All machines running !LanMan98 must be correctly set up to use TCP/IP.

* All PC servers to which access is required must be running TCP/IP, and must
  have "File and print sharing via TCP/IP" enabled.

If either of these conditions isn't met, then there is no point continuing
any further through these instructions as it won't work at the end! Go away
and sort these out, then come back here. You may find the 'Hints on
networking' section below helpful here.


Installation for use as a standalone application
================================================
LanMan98 2.07 onwards is supplied ready-to-use as a standalone RISC OS 
application, and does not need to be modified in any way before use.
Simply copy !LanMan98 to your main drive - perhaps in the Network(ing)
folder, or Apps.  Whenever you wish to use !LanMan98, just double-click the
application, or better still place the application in your !Boot, inside the
Choices.Boot.Tasks directory, so that it will be invoked automatically when
you switch on your computer.


Installation for use with !Omniclient or !NTFiler
=================================================
In the same directory as this file you are now reading, you will see the main
!LanMan98 application, and a sub-directory called "OmniPlugin".  The !LanMan98
in the OmniPlugin folder will convert your copy of !LanMan98 for use with
OmniClient or NTFiler.

Drag the !LanMan98 application to a sutiable directory on your main drive
(as described in the previous section), then open the OmniPlugin folder
and drag the enclosed !LanMan98 over the top of the one you just placed on
your main drive.  This will update it according. 

Whenever you wish to use !LanMan98, just double-click the
application, or better still place the application in your !Boot, inside the
Choices.Boot.Tasks directory, so that it will be invoked automatically when
you switch on your computer.

If you ever need to convert back to a standalone copy, go into the
"Restore" sub-directory of OmniPlugin, and drag *that* version on top of
!LanMan98 on your main drive.


TIP - if the "drag on top" method doesn't seem to work, or achieve the
desired results, make sure your computer is set to overwrite things when
copying.  To do this, press Menu (middle) mouse button over any Filer 
window, and go to Options.  Make sure "Force" is ticked, whilst "Newer"
is NOT ticked.  This will ensure the program gets properly updated when
you drag one on top of the other.


Using !LanMan98 as a standalone application
===========================================
When you double-click the !LanMan98 application (or on computer startup,
should you have !LanMan98 in your boot sequence), an unnamed icon will appear
on the left of the icon bar; it look like a mini-tower case with a Windows
logo painted on the side.  This is !LanMan98 in its dormant state.

To connect to a share for the first time, click the middle button on the bar
icon and select "New...".  This will open a dialogue box, via which you can
provide details of the share.  For the "Local name", you choose a name by
which you wish the share to be known on the RISC OS side.  For "Server", you
must supply the name of the machine on which the remote share resides.  And
for "Share" you must supply the name of that share as known to the remote
machine.  Some shares will require "User name" and/or "Password" to be filled
in; others will not.

Now click the "Connect" button.  If a connection is successfully made then
the unnamed icon dissappears, and a new icon appears carrying below it your
chosen local name for the share.  You can simply click SELECT on the new icon
to open a filer window on the root directory of the share, and then use it
just as you would any other disc accessible by your machine.

Repeat the instruction in the above two paragraphs for each share to which
you need access.  Each will present itself as a new icon on the icon bar.

The typing in of the share's details is necessary only when you first connect
to it.  Each successfully connected share is remembered by !LanMan98.  To see
the known shares, click SELECT on the unnamed icon (when !LanMan98 is
dormant), click ADJUST on any of !LanMan98's disc icons, or select "Show
discs" from the menu.  A filer window will open showing all the known shares;
you simply need double-click them to reform the connections (you can also
drag groups of them to the icon bar for fast forming of connections to
multiple shares).  If a password was provided at the last time of connection
to a share then the password is not remembered, but the fact that a password
was given is remembered, and the usual "Connect" dialogue box appears, with
all but the password filled in.


Using !LanMan98 with !Omniclient
================================
!LanMan98 is not able to browse your network (i.e., it cannot automatically
produce a list of all the shares visible from your machine).  However, if you
have LanManFS (as you may well do if you are running !Omniclient) then
!LanMan98 can make use of LanManFS's browsing capabilities.  This being the
case, each auto-detected PC share on your local network will appear twice in
!Omniclient's "FS list", once with the usual LanManFS icon, and secondly with
a more colourful icon.  To access a mount via LanManFS, double-click the old
grey icon; to access a mount via LanMan98, double-click the more colourful
one.  Also from !Omniclient's main menu, you can follow "Mounts", "Protocols"
and then click "LanMan98"; this opens a dialogue box into which to type the
details of the share to be mounted.


Using !LanMan98 with !NTFiler
=============================
!NTFiler will automatically detect the presence of !LanMan98 and make use of
it.


File types
==========
Within the !LanMan98 application is a file named "Mappings".  The lines of
that file specify a mapping from DOS name extensions to RISC OS file types.
You can alter this file, but it is probably best not to make a habit of it.
Modern versions of RISC OS also have a system wide MimeMap file, which contains
similar mappings and also associated MIME types. LanMan98 will look in its own
mappings file first, and if a match is not found there then it will check the
system MimeMap file. If you need to add a filetype mapping, then it is strongly
recommended that you only add it to the system MimeMap, as other applications
can then also make use of the mapping.
The mappings have two effects.  They determine the RISC OS file type for files
that originate from the PC, and they control whether files originating from
RISC OS need to have file type information hidden in their names.

For example:

The file xxx.txt created on the PC will appear as xxx.txt from LanMan98 and
with file type "Text", because the Mappings file takes the extension txt to
the hexidecimal number &fff, which is the RISC OS code for "Text".

Likewise, a file xxx.txt with file type "Text" created with LanMan98 will
appear on the PC as xxx.txt.

But a file xxx.txt created with file type "Data" appears on the PC as
xxx.txt,ffd  The ",ffd" part recording the file type (&ffd is the RISC OS code
for "Data").

The general rule is, leave the mapping file alone, and things will work
without you having to think about it, but if you often change the Mappings
file be careful.  One important case: if you backup your PC via LanMan98 then
you should save the Mappings file with the backup, because it is essential
that the same Mappings file is used when Restoring the backup.

The default type for a file with no extension is Text, but this can be changed
by setting the system variable LanMan98$DefaultType (see the !Run file).

For people who desperately want to avoid the hidden RISC OS, file-type codes
being tagged to file names, LanMan98 provides a way to avoid them through use
of special fields.  For example, if you have a share mounted with name PC1
say then typing, at the command line,

  *Filer_OpenDir LanMan98#notypes::PC1.$

will open a filer window via which files can be created without the hidden
type codes being being appended to the file names, and within which any
already existing type codes are made visible.


Hidden files
============
In its default configuration, LanMan98 respects the DOS hidden file
attribute, and will not display hidden files.  To override this behaviour,
set the system variable LanMan98$ShowHidden (any value will do).  There
is already a commented out line in the !Run file that does this.  Once
the variable is set, all subsequently made connections will allow access
to hidden files.


Accessing shares across the internet
====================================
An additional feature of LanMan98, over those provided by the original
LanManFS, is that you can mount remote machines via the internet.  To do this
you must specify the internet address of the server as well as its name.  For
an example of how to do this, we'll use SUN Microsystem's doc.ic.ac.uk site.

The share name is

    \\sunsite\packages

If this was on you local network, you could access it with !Omniclient by
using

    SUNSITE

as the "Server", and

    packages

as the "Share".

But across the internet "SUNSITE" isn't enough to find it.  You also need to
specify that the internet address as being sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk.  LanMan98
will accept this extra information, surrounded by angle brackets, appended to
the server name.  So you should use

    SUNSITE<sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk>

as the server name.


Remote printing
===============
If you are using !LanMan98 with !Omniclient, and you have the LanManFS module
loaded then carry on as you did before; !LanMan98 will not stand in the way
of remote printing through !Omniclient.

If you are using !LanMan98 in stand-alone mode then you should use a slightly
different procedure.  Consider the case where you have a PC called "PC1" that
allows access to a printer under the share name "EPSON".  You should set up
!Printers as though you had a printer of the type in question directly
connected to your computer, accept when filling in the details of the
"Connections" dialogue box.  Here you should check the "File" radio button
and type in, as the file name

    LanMan98#printer;PC1;EPSON:

Every character in this file name is important including the ":" on the end.
You can add a user name and/or password after the printer name.

    LanMan98#printer;PC1;EPSON;username;password:

Commands
========
LanMan98 has commands equivalent to the *Connect, *Disconnect, *LMLogon and
*LMLogoff of LanManFS: they are *Connect98, *Disconnect98, *LMLogon98 and
*LMLogoff98.  You may find you need to use upper case characters in
specifying the share name for *Connect98.


Interaction with Fresco
=======================
Fresco is slightly unusual in that it accesses files under callback.
Although this is a perfectly legitimate thing to do, almost all TCP/IP based,
remote file systems are flawed in a way that causes errors under such
conditions.  The file acccesses that are faulted are those to files within
the !Scrap directory; so the problem is manifest only when your !Scrap
directory is on a remote server accessed via TCP/IP.

Fresco has been patched to recognise both ShareFS and LanManFS so as to avoid
the problem, although this does mean that it works less efficiently with them.

!LanMan98, in its default configuration, suffers in the same way as other
TCP/IP based file systems, but it can be configured to completely solve the
problem (whether for Fresco or for any other call-back-using application).
To protect !LanMan98 against call backs, you should set the system variable
LanMan98$CallBackPatch; any value will do so long as the variable is set, and
provided the setting of it is performed before the LanMan98 module is loaded.
There is a line to uncomment in the !Run file specifically for this purpose.
The patch uses undocumented features of RISC OS and may fail with some
versions of RISC OS or some versions of the Internet module.


Trouble shooting
================
If attempts to mount shares give the error message "Cannot find given
server", or if attempts to logon to a domain fail to mount your home
directory, then it may be that your network has a NetBIOS name server and
LanMan98 can't find it.  Try setting the system variable LanMan98$NameServer,
by typing

    Set LanMan98$NameServer <IP address>

where <IP address> is the network address of the name server in
ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd format.  If you have one particularly powerful PC running
Windows NT, then that is probably the name server.  If this does not solve
the problem, try also typing

    RMKill LanManFS

It may be that LanManFS is preventing LanMan98 from receiving replies from
the name server.

LanMan98 will also look in your "hosts" file to try and find the IP address
of a server, so adding a line in you host file for each of the PCs on your
network might help.


Name resolution
===============
CIFS servers typically have two names; a DNS hostname and a NetBIOS name. While
it is possible for these two names to be different, to avoid confusion it is
strongly recommended that you ensure they are set to the same value. The name
that you specify in the server field in the connection dialogue box should be
the NetBIOS name of the server.
LanMan98 must convert the server name into an IP address, and it will try three
different methods to do this. First it will make a NetBIOS broadcast, and see
if any machines respond. If this fails, and the LanMan98$NameServer system
variable is set, then it will ask that NetBIOS name server (sometime referred to
as a WINS server) to translate the name. If this still fails, then LanMan98 will
ask the DNS resolver to translate the name.
When the name has been translated to an IP address, LanMan98 can start
connecting to the server. As part of the connection process, it must send the
NetBIOS name of the server to the server, and the server may check that this
name matches what it expects. If it doesn't match, the server may return the
error "Session refused (NetBIOS name not present)".
If angle brackets are used in the server field, as described in the "Accessing
shares across the internet" section above, then the name outside the angle
brackets is the NetBIOS name which is not translated, and the part inside the
brackets is used to find the IP address of the server only by doing a DNS
lookup.


Problems with Raw Reads
=======================

Certain devices, notably Windows Vista and some Buffalo NAS boxes claim to
support 'Raw Reads', but actually do not. LanMan98 is smart enough to spot
Windows Vista and to avoid using raw reads with it, but with other devices
it can run into problems.

Raw reads are faster than other reads, so simply avoiding using Raw reads would
hurt the performance of LanMan98 with well behaved servers. To this end, the
default is for LanMan98 to use Raw Reads.

If you have a device that is problematic, simply edit !LanMan98.!Run to comment
out the line that Sets LanMan98$RawRead, save the file, reboot and retry.


Hints on Networking
===================

This section is intended to help people through some common problems with
setting networks up; it is not a definitive guide, and we can't offer
assistance with you in performing these steps, but hopefully this should
help people over the steps.

Q) What hardware do I need to talk to machines on my LAN?

A) You need a network card. These can be bought from your local dealer,
or from dealers you see advertising in the RISC OS press. Some new machines
are being brought out with network cards built in; check with the vendor
of your machine as to whether you need one or not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) What hardware do I need to talk to machines over the Internet?

A) Just your modem. First, connect to the internet as usual, then you can
use LanMan98 to talk to remote servers as described above. LanMan98 will
not handle dialing up to the internet, mail transfer or anything like that;
it simply makes use of the connection once it has been established.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) I've stuck a network card in my machine - is that it?

A) No. As well as having the hardware in your machine you need to run some
software on your machine to make it all work. You need to run a 'TCP/IP
stack' to make everything work. The best way to get a TCP/IP stack on your
machine is simply to run the new !Boot structure (available on various ftp
and WWW sites, several CD ROMs, and supplied with both new computers and
with RISC OS 4).

Run !Boot, then go to the network setup icon. Next click the Internet icon
and ensure that 'Enable TCP/IP Protocol Suite' is ticked.

You now need to ensure that this setup application can see your network
interface, and you that the computer can find an IP address for your
machine. Exactly how you do this can be simple (add one manually
in the interfaces box/hosts file), or very complex (maintain a domain name
server). There is no way that a simple guide like this can help you
through this, so your best bet is to contact whoever sold you the network
card (or machine) to talk you through this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) I have a network card installed, and I can see my other RISC OS machine
on the network. Everything must be setup OK, yes?

A) No. RISC OS machines can talk to one another using the 'Acorn Access'
protocol. While this talks down the same wires as TCP/IP, it will often work
while TCP/IP isn't setup right. You still need to setup TCP/IP as above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) OK. I have a network card, and I think I've set up TCP/IP, but how can
I tell?

A) The best test to see whether your TCP/IP stack is working or not is to try
to 'ping' the other machine. 'ping' is a very simple program that sends a
'packet' down the network to the remote machine. If it gets there it will be
sent back. This basically checks that the network is working at the the lowest
possible level.

To try pinging a machine, go to the command line (in a taskwindow or by
pressing f12) and type:

ping <machine-name>

(where obviously you replace <machine-name> with the name or IP address of
the remote machine.) It should be clear from the messages displayed whether
packets are getting through or not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) I can't ping the remote machine! Why?

A) Tons of reasons. Here are some of the most popular:

 * The internet stack is not properly set up on one of the machines. Talk
to your dealers.

 * Something is wrong with the physical connection between the machines; if
you are using BNC connectors and co-axial cable, then make sure it is
properly terminated. If you are using a twisted pair (also known as RJ45)
lead without a hub then make sure it is a "cross-over" cable. If you are
using twisted pair leads with a hub then make sure that the hub is
powered, that the leads aren't connected to the 'uplink' port and that the
lights on the hub show that a sucessful connection is present. If any of
these is a problem then talk to the dealer that sold you the hardware.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) I have a problem with making TCP/IP work on my hardware, and my dealer
is useless! He can't/won't help me! What should I do?

A) Give us a ring. We can't promise to help, but we will do our best. It is
important that you do try your dealer first though otherwise we will get
overwhelmed with requests and will have to cut back on the help we can give.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) I can ping the machine, but now I still can't make LanMan98 work with it.
What do I do?

A) Read through the instructions above again step by step and check that you
have done everything necessary. (Most of our support calls are caused by
people not reading the instructions properly). If you are still stuck, then
try to get your phone as near as possible to your computer and give us a ring.
