!BaseLIB is a set of libraries for basic functionality -
threading, debugging, error/exception handling, callbacks etc.

!FSLib is a set of libraries for Filing System implementations.

!PGMod is a set of libraries for doing Wimp stuff (just used
for the LanMan98 Filer application, not for the core FS). This
won't be needed for Omniclient based installations.

!StubsG is Justin Fletchers C 26/32bit neutral Stubs.  Moving to
this was a relatively recent change, when moving to 32bit.  It
allows LanMan98 to work on all generations of TCP/IP-enabled
RISC OS computers.

The sources for the libs are included inside them.

LanMan contains the main LanMan98 sources themselves.


This code may try to include headers etc for MemCheck which is part
of DrSmiths C Development Toolkit. If it does just comment out the
includes and don't build the memcheck targets :)
