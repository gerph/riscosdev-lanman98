About Error Blocks

Error blocks are allocated to third parties who need their own unique error
numbers (e.g. for a module).  They are usually allocation on a block per
company basis but can be allocated on a module basis if your module requires
lots of error numbers.   Error Blocks are allocated in blocks of 255 (&100).

If an Error block is required then you will need to ensure that the 'block
required' option is turned on and a description of what it is going to be
used for is entered.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
