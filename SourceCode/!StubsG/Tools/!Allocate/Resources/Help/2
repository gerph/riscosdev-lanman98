About Reservations

To avoid clashes within the system, RISC OS requires many different names to
be unique.  The categories for these names are as follows :-

  Application names
  Module names
  Names of Sprites that reside in the Wimp Sprite Pool
  Environment (System) variables
  Font names
  Star Commands
  Scrap directories
  ResourceFS directory names
  Transient (utilities) names
  
You will need to ensure that all the names that your software uses are
registered with the allocations service, so that name clashing is not
incurred.  Names should be registered at the start of product development
(not at the end!) as a reservation request will be rejected if the name is
already being used by somebody else.

To reserve a name you will need to enter the text (e.g. '!Allocate' as an
application name) and the type (e.g. AppName).  The type of name is entered
by selecting the appropriate one from the Type popup menu.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
