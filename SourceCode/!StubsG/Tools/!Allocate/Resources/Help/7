About draw objects

Draw object blocks are allocated for applications which implement their own
objects in draw files.  They are allocated in blocks of &40.  A block is
allocated to a company, not to an individual product.  A new allocation can
be requested once a current one has been exhausted.

If a draw object block is required then you will need to ensure that the
'block required' option is turned on and a description of what it will be
used for is entered.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
