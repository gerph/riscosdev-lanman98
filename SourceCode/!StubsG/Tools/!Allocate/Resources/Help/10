About Devices

Device Id's are allocated to third parties who have a device which needs to
support the Device Claim Protocol (see the Programmers Reference Manual for
more information).

If a Device Id is required then you will need to enter the name of the device
and a description of its use.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
