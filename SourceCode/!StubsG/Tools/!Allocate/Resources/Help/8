About Filing Systems

A Filing System number is allocated to a third party when they wish to
implement their own RISC OS Filing System.

If a Filing Sytem number is required, then you will need to enter the name of
the Filing System (e.g. SCSIFS) and the name that is used to select it (e.g.
SCSI).

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
