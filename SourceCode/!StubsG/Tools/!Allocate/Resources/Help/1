About Messages

Message blocks are allocated to third parties who have developed an
application that implements a Wimp Message Protocol.  They are allocated in
blocks of 64 (&40) and allocated as one block per protocol.

If a Message block is required then you will need to ensure that the 'block
required' option is turned on and enter a description of what the block will
be used for.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
