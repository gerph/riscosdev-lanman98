About Service Calls

A Service Call block is allocated to a third party who wishes to implement
service calls in their modules (see the Programmers Reference Manual for more
information).  They are allocated on a per company basis.

If a Service Call block is required then you will need to ensure that the
'block required' option is selected and you have entered a description of
what the block will be used for.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
