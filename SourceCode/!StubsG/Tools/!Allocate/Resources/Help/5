About Podules

Podule allocations are made for third parties who are developing Expansion
Cards.  Before a RISC OS Expansion Card can be implemented a Podule Id is
required and a Manufacturer's Number.  If a Manufacturer's Number has not
been allocated for your company then you will need to ensure that the
'Allocate' option is turned on.  If you already have a Manufacturer's Number
then you will need to enter it the Id field.

If a Podule Id is required then you will need to enter the name of the podule
and a description of what it will be used for.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add' 
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
