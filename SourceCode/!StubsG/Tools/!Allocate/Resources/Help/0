About SWI Chunks

SWI Chunks are allocated to third parties who have developed modules that
require SWI numbers for system extensions.  They are allocated in blocks of
64 (&40) and are given on a one-per-module basis.

If a SWI Chunk is required, you will need to enter a prefix for the SWI Chunk
and a description of what it will be used for.

To add the allocation to the list you will need to click SELECT on the 'Add'
icon.

To abort this operation you should click SELECT on the 'Cancel' icon.
