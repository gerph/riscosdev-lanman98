Library names
=============

The libraries supplied have been given consistent names in order to ensure
that when sources are transferred between environments, the type of library
in use is still known. The libraries supplied follow a set naming scheme :

  o.<name>
     26bit library, compiled for use within applications
  o.<name>zm
     26bit library, compiled for use within modules or applications
  o.<name>-32
     32bit library, compiled for use within applications
  o.<name>zm-32
     32bit library, compiled for use within modules or applications

The only exception to this naming scheme is C:o.StubsG which is a 32bit
library, compatible with either module or application code.


Libraries
=========

The following libraries are supplied with this release :

  TCPIPLibs:o.inetlib[zm][-32]
  TCPIPLibs:o.socklib[zm][-32]
  TCPIPLibs:o.socklib5[zm][-32]
  TCPIPLibs:o.unixlib[zm][-32]
  C:o.StubsG
  TBox:o.toolboxlib[zm][-32]
  TBox:o.eventlib[zm][-32]
  TBox:o.renderlib[zm][-32]
  RISC_OSLib:o.risc_oslib[zm][-32]
  flexlib.o.flexlib[zm][-32]

Some of these libraries do not differ between the module and non-module
versions of the library, but have been supplied for consistency of naming
and use.
