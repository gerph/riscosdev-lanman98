RISC_OSLib
==========

The use of RISC_OSLib has been deprecated for a number of years. However, in
order to provide an upgrade path for applications built with this library, a
'snapshot' of the state of the current version of RISC_OSLib has been
produced. This version of the library is not supported in any significant
manner and is provided 'as-is'.
