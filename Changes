v2.08
~~~~~
* All files re-licensed under CDDL Open Source licence

* Username / password in front end UI character limit increased 

* When module registers with OmniClient, it now registers "omni_lm98"
  sprite rather than !lanman98 so that different art/thene can be used
  with Omni as compared with standalone front end.

v2.07
~~~~~
* RISC OS Developments Open Source release

* RISC OS 5 styled icons used on OS5
  Old icons included for OS4.x and earlier


v2.05/06
~~~~~~~~
* List of changes not available / unknown

v2.04
~~~~~
* Fix for unaligned access that stopped LanMan98 working with BeagleBoard.
  (Thanks to Alex Waugh for this, and most other v2.00+ work)

v2.03
~~~~~
* Allow IP address to be given after server name in {} in printer server field.

v2.01
~~~~~
* More timeout problems solved.

* Add a LanMan98$RawRead system variable to control whether raw reads are used
  or not (solves problems with badly behaved NAS).

v2.00
~~~~~
* Fix timeouts when connecting to Windows Vista.

* Work around several unsupported or buggy features in various NAS servers.

* Implemented support for LM and NTLM encrypted passwords.

* Improved handling of hidden files (They are still hidden from directory
  enumerations, but they can now be accessed directly by name).

* Changed default filetype to text.

* The frontend now remembers which mount link was loaded, and saves any
  changes back to it rather than creating a new link.

* Fixed a couple of bugs in the free space display.

* Improved some error messages.

v1.20
~~~~~
* Reorder name/name,### search for files that end in ~1 etc, so that I
  don't lose the file type.  Necessary because Windows allows access
  to both DOS and full names.

* Avoid NULL indirection in printer code.  Caused crashing when attempting
  to print to NT with insufficient access.

v1.19
~~~~~
* Ignore atributes outside of 0xFF, so to avoid files being copied from
  NetFS being given random combinations of the properties system, hidden
  and read only.

v1.18
~~~~~
* Connect window provided with option to save the password.

* Printer support avoids creating empty files when RiscOS tests the connection.

* GO back to using TCPIP v4 for support of old machines.

v1.17
~~~~~
* Stopped death of the server causing LanMan98 to crash.  It was a bad
interaction between the reconnection and keepalive mechanisms - now cured.
Also added code so that once a reconnection attempt fails, then all accesses
made in the next three seconds fail immediately.  This was needed because the
Filer asks for file details during redraws, and ignores error returns; hence
filer redraws could take timeout_period * No_of_files, if it wasn't for this
fix.

* Made hourglass appear while waiting for replies from the server.

* Made chockblock code work for all versions of RiscOS >= 0xA8.

v1.16
~~~~~
* Built with version of FSLIB that prevents the bug that causes copied
file to get the server's idea of now as their creation time.  Bug reappeared
because I didn't give him the FSLIB patch.

* 6-char extensions.

* NC excepts OS version above 106

v1.15
~~~~~
* Fixed "Broken pipe" when clicking bar icon problem.

* Made Filer icons the right size under RiscOS 3.1

* NC only version for Presedence.

* Fixed bug that made creating hidden files fall over.

v1.14
~~~~~
* Partial cure of "Broken pipe" problem.

* Altered parsing of printer file to allow for password with no user, and for
options.

* RiscOS 4 compatible version of CallBackPatch

* Mimetype support.

* notypes invokable from front end

* notypes shares closed on dismount

v1.13
~~~~~
* Made date and time swapping determined by tests on first file
  accessed. Microsoft can't even be consistent about getting it wrong.

v1.12
~~~~~
* Swapped order of date and time in TRANS2_QUERY_PATH_INFO; Oh thank you
  Microsoft!

* Try set-attr with last-write times for NT, and catch errors from W95, in
  which case go back to opening and closing the file.

* Linked with version of FSLIB that enables File 0 (Save) to get around
  date not being set with filer-action copies to NT.  Suspected RiscOS bug.

v1.11
~~~~~
* Allow user name and password to be specified within a printer specifier.

* Allow the password to be omitted from the command *LMLogon98

* Send username and password even if the server doesn't ask for it.  Samba
  needs this.

v1.10
~~~~~
* Reimplemented interface to Free module because the change to the FS word
  made in v1.08 causes OS_FSControl 49 to be disabled.

v1.09
~~~~~
* Cured problem with enumeration of empty root directories.

* Permit changing of default file type by setting system variable.

v1.08
~~~~~
* Reduced flush delay to 1cs, but allowed 100 failures before giving up.

* Retract claim in FS word that image support is required. This stops the
  problem with the system heap growing, for some unknown reason.

* Make directory enumeration conform to the defacto standard rather than
  the PRMs, so that Acorn's broken "Repeat" will work.

v1.07
~~~~~
* Implemented raw reads to improve speed.

* Made "notypes" mode show the full file names, including the ,XXX part.

* Fixed the problem with my last attempt at fixing the Fresco problem.

* Changed from using the system variable LanMan98$FrescoPatch to
  LanMan98$CallBackPatch.

* Made directory enumeration sensitive to the "end of search" flag, rather
  than waiting for a search that returns no entries.  Hope this gets around
  a problem with LanMan98 looping on a file called "<7f>".

* All system variables now prefixed by LanMan98 rather than just LanMan

* Reenstated flush delay for "non-specific" error.

v1.06
~~~~~
* Allowed for failure of NetBIOS name service socket, due to presence of
  LanManFS.  Also try broadcast of node status requests.  These two changes
  make locating of the PDC more likely during domain logon.

* Cut out some rubbish to make the module smaller.

* Made LanMan98 respect the hidden file attribute, unless the system variable
  LanMan$ShowHidden is set.

* Fixed Fresco problem.

v1.05
~~~~~
* Obtain file details via TRANS2_QUERY_PATH_INFORMATION (where possible) to
  allow access to files within non-readable directories.

* Removed flushing delay for the "Windows 95 is thinking about it" error.

* Stored last-used username and password for each connected server, for reuse
  as defaults.

* Made all disconnects close the associated filer windows with Filer_CloseDir.

* Ensured that ,XXX is recognised as a RiscOS type only when it is the end of
  the name.

* Use LanMan$NameServer and LanMan$Scope in place of commands.

* Improved NetBIOS name resolution.  First try broadcast; then try the name
  server (assuming LanMan$NameServer is set); then try gethostbyname.

* Implemented domain logon, with automatic mounting of the homedir-containing
  share, and setting of the LanMan$Homedir system variable.

* Fixed a bug in the code for protecting LanMan98 against reentrance.  Also
  made a version that handles reentrance (but it has strange interference with
  the WIMP).

* Make length-setting on printer files a null action, rather than throwing an
  exception.

v1.04
~~~~~
* Added HTML and JPEG to the mapping file.

* Corrected flaw in print streaming exception handling.  Caused !Printers to
  crash if connection failed.

* Decreased maximum size of read to fix SAMBA's tendency to drop the last byte
  in a maximally sized read.

v1.03
~~~~~
* Disconnect98 allows user name without password.

* Errors returned to ShowFree.

* Front end replacement for !Omniclient.

* Remote printing implemented.

v1.02
~~~~~
* Simple ARM coded version of longjmp and setjmp used in exception
  handling and threading.

v1.01
~~~~~
* Put CR in place of NL in help strings.

* Stoped SMB error numbers being returned to RiscOS.

* Error 0x01, 0x43 given message.

* "notypes" special field introduced.

* Filer_CloseDir on dismount.

* Corrected bug in file-opening, exception handling.

* Disconnect old connections on reuse of mount name.

* Check for multiple connections to shares.

* Force disconnect of all shares on module finalise.

* Use of Properly allocated SWI chunk and file system number.

v1.00
~~~~~
First complete version.
